#there are a couple of ways to initialize lists
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim"]
#like so
#anything can go inside a list.
#they don't even need to be the same type
info = ["Kevin", 24, False]

#every element can be accessed by it's index
#a subset can be specified, like so
friends[1:]
#which would give me the elements except the one in index 0
#also, stuff like
friends[-1]
#equals
#friends[lastIndex]
#and such
